# ThunderRepo

Hello! Thanks for stopping by my github profile. Although my path to learn Python has just started, I will be posting up my current projects I am working on outside of my job, and teaching myself Python. I have a few already that I am proud of creating and getting them to work and look forward to many more! 

Thank you,

TJ
